To use this sample project you need gulp installed (`npm install -g gulp`).

The default task will execute `gulp serve` which build the sources, watch for changes
and serve them on port [8080](http://localhost:8080).

You will find several comments in the sources and build files and I wrote a
how to use AngularJS with ECMAScript 6.
